It includes a simple and fluid tool for defining aggregates, events, services and commands which generates the skeleton code required for all of these items, saving time and achieving consistency.\r\n\r\nThe framework uses [MassTransit](http://masstransit-project.com/) as a message bus wrapper, which means that you could use either [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com) or [MSMQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Message_Queuing) as an event queue. \r\nEvents are persisted through the excellent [NEventStore](http://neventstore.org) library which has support for a wide range of databases including [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net) and various flavours of SQL.\r\n\r\nA basic and functional example of a domain built with the framework is included under the Cuttlefish.ExampleApp.Domain folder. It illustrates the use of commands, aggregates, services and events in the context of the Cuttlefish framework.\r\n\r\n#####Quick Setup\r\nGetting the framework up and running is super easy. Assuming that we are using RabbitMQ with a MongoDB event store backing, we would set up the framework as follows:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Starts up the configuration interface\r\nCore.Configure()\r\n \r\n    // Specify which root namespace reflection should use for finding aggregates, \r\n\t// events and commands.\r\n    .WithDomainNamespaceRoot(\"MyCompany.MyApp.Domain\")\r\n\r\n    // For testing and extension purposes only at present, specifies which in-memory cache to \r\n\t// use for storing the latest aggregate state\r\n\t.UseInMemoryCache()\r\n\r\n    // Configures NEventStore, more info available on https://github.com/NEventStore/NEventStore\r\n\t.UseNEventStore(Wireup.Init()\r\n\t\t.UsingMongoPersistence(\"eventstore\", new DocumentObjectSerializer())\r\n\t\t\t.Build())\r\n\r\n    // Configures the aggregate update publisher, which will push entire aggregates to the \r\n\t// message queue for consumption by Interceptors later.\r\n\t.UseMassTransitAggregateUpdatePublisher(ServiceBusFactory.New(sbc =>\r\n    {\r\n        sbc.ReceiveFrom(\"rabbitmq://localhost/aggregate_updates\");\r\n    }))\r\n\r\n\t// Wires everything up for us.\r\n    .Done();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will wire up all the components required by the framework.  Out of the box, you get:\r\n\r\n* integration with RabbitMQ through MassTransit\r\n* integration with NEventStore using any of the supported persistence adapters. (Mongo, Raven, MS/MySQL)\r\n* a very basic low-volume in-memory aggregate cache (for testing and small projects)\r\n* a mongo aggregate cache which saves the latest version of each aggregate to disc using MongoDB\r\n* dependency injection using StructureMap\r\n\r\n###Future Plans\r\nThe framework is easy to extend and there are plans in the pipeline to support the following features:\r\n\r\n*\tDistributed command handler\r\n*\tAuto-generated SignalR endpoints for decorated aggregate events\r\n*\tAuto-generated ASP.NET MVC controller endpoints for calling domain commands\r\n*\tThe ability to run an in-memory environment for prototyping purposes based purely on the domain specification file. (long term goal)\r\n\r\n###The framework consists of the following core components:\r\n#####Core\r\nThe core provides the most basic functionality as well as base classes and interfaces for defining aggregates, services, commands and events. \r\n\r\nThe 4 things you'll need to work with to start setting up your domain are commands, events, services and aggregates.\r\n\r\n######Commands\r\nWe'll start with commands. They tell our domain what to do. They can be defined by implementing the ICommand interface as below. Commands are handled by either aggregates or services, but we'll get to how that works in a bit.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class StartStockingProduct : ICommand\r\n{\r\n    private readonly int _version;\r\n\r\n    private StartStockingProduct()\r\n    {\r\n        _version = 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public StartStockingProduct(Guid aggregateidentity, String itemcode, String name, \r\n                                String description, String barcode) : this()\r\n    {\r\n        AggregateIdentity = aggregateidentity;\r\n        ItemCode = itemcode;\r\n        Name = name;\r\n        Description = description;\r\n        Barcode = barcode;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String ItemCode { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Name { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Description { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Barcode { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n    public int Version\r\n    {\r\n        get { return _version; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Guid AggregateIdentity { get; private set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, we are creating a command which tells the warehouse service to start stocking a certain product. The command conveys information that would be required by the domain to perform the action the command triggers.\r\n\r\nTo execute commands against domain services or aggregates, we make use of the CommandRouter. The router is clever enough to know which service or aggregate should react to the command. Only a single handler may be registered to handle commands. The code below illustrates how we would execute a command through the router.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n_productName = \"Widget X\";\r\n_description = \"blah blah blah\";\r\n_itemcode = \"X0001\";\r\n_barcode = \"123456\";\r\n\r\nvar newProductCommand = new StartStockingProduct(Guid.NewGuid(), _itemcode, \r\n    _productName, _description, _barcode);\r\n\r\nCommandRouter.ExecuteCommand(newProductCommand);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the command router knows which handler the command should be routed to. The service or aggregate would then respond by persisting an event of what has been executed to the eventstore. More on that later...\r\n\r\n######Services\r\n\r\nWhat do these aggregates and services look like? You might ask. Well, here is an example of a service which models the way a warehouse might work in an over-simplified business scenario.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class WarehouseService : IService\r\n{\r\n    public void On(StartStockingProduct cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!BarcodeLengthIsCorrect(cmd.Barcode))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new InvalidBarcodeException(cmd.Barcode);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!NameIsValid(cmd.Name))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new ProductStockingException(cmd);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(\r\n            new NewProductAddedToWarehouse(cmd.AggregateIdentity,\r\n                                                  cmd.ItemCode, cmd.Name,\r\n                                                  cmd.Description,\r\n                                                  cmd.Barcode));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void On(Rename cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!NameIsValid(cmd.Name))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new ProductStockingException(cmd);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new Renamed(cmd.AggregateIdentity, \r\n            cmd.Name));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void On(AcceptShipmentOfProduct cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!IsValidQuantity(cmd.Quantity))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new InvalidQuantityException();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new StockReceived(cmd.AggregateIdentity, \r\n            cmd.Quantity));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void On(BookOutStockAgainstOrder cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!IsValidQuantity(cmd.Quantity))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new InvalidQuantityException();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!ItemIsInStockForQuantityRequired(cmd.AggregateIdentity, cmd.Quantity))\r\n        {\r\n            throw new OutOfStockException();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new StockBookedOut(cmd.AggregateIdentity, \r\n            cmd.Quantity));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void On(SuspendSaleOfProduct cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new Suspended(cmd.AggregateIdentity));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void On(DiscontinueProduct cmd)\r\n    {\r\n        EventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new Discontinued(cmd.AggregateIdentity));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #region Validation Rules\r\n\r\n    private static bool ItemIsInStockForQuantityRequired(Guid aggregateIdentity, int quantityRequired)\r\n    {\r\n        var product = AggregateBuilder.Get<ProductAggregate>(aggregateIdentity);\r\n        return product.QuantityOnHand >= quantityRequired;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static bool BarcodeLengthIsCorrect(string barcode)\r\n    {\r\n        const int barcodeLength = 6;\r\n        return barcode.Length == barcodeLength;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static bool NameIsValid(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static bool IsValidQuantity(int quantity)\r\n    {\r\n        return quantity > 0;\r\n    }\r\n    #endregion\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the code above, we can see that services implement the _IService_ interface, which is used to decorate the resulting class as being a service.\r\n\r\nWe also see a bunch of _On_ methods; each accepting a single command object as a parameter. These are the command handlers. Aggregates are also able to have command handlers, in cases where it makes sense to model the domain in such a manner. The role of a command handler is to establish whether a command is valid and the state of the aggregate in question permits the action which the command is trying to execute. If all goes well and the command is able to execute without failing business rule validation, an event is created to signify that an action has taken place.\r\n\r\nThe event router is used to publish events from Services. This is done by simply calling the event router and providing an event with the required parameters and type.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nEventRouter.FireEventOnAggregate<ProductAggregate>(new Discontinued(cmd.AggregateIdentity));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will cause an event to be persisted to the event store; the event to be published to the messagebus (if specified in the core setup); and if enabled, it will also cause the latest version of the aggregate which responds to the event (if any) to be published to the specified cache.\r\n\r\nThe last thing we see in our service, is that there are a few methods that wrap business logic or validation logic. It is a good idea to put these into separate methods, as business logic is often re-used within an application domain.\r\n\r\n######Events \r\n\r\nEvents are very similar to commands in that they are merely carriers of information. In the case of commands, we wish to _carry intent_. In the case of events, we wish to carry _'what has been done'_. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class StockReceived : IEvent\r\n{\r\n    private readonly int _version;\r\n\r\n    private StockReceived()\r\n    {\r\n        _version = 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public StockReceived(Guid aggregateidentity, Int32 quantity) : this()\r\n    {\r\n        AggregateIdentity = aggregateidentity;\r\n        Quantity = quantity;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Int32 Quantity { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n    public int Version\r\n    {\r\n        get { return _version; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Guid AggregateIdentity { get; private set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe event above is raised when the _AcceptShipmentOfProduct_ command is handled in our service. We could have easily put the command handler on the _ProductAggregate_ if we wanted to, but in this case, it made more semantic sense to let the warehouse take care of accepting shipments.\r\n\r\nThe event only contains information that is required to process the fact that stock has been received. In the next section we will take a look at the way events are handled by aggregates.\r\n\r\n######Aggregates\r\n\r\nAggregates are the meat of our domain. They are generally models of real-world items or documents and should be rich and extensive. In the example below, we are modeling a product from a warehouse perspective. The warehouse doesn't care about pricing information, as its main area of concern is stock levels and maintaining a catalogue.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ProductAggregate : AggregateBase\r\n{\r\n    public ProductAggregate() : base(new List<IEvent>())\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ProductAggregate(IEnumerable<IEvent> events) : base(events)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public DateTime LastChanged { get; private set; }\r\n    public String ItemCode { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Name { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Description { get; private set; }\r\n    public String Barcode { get; private set; }\r\n    public Boolean Suspended { get; private set; }\r\n    public Boolean Discontinued { get; private set; }\r\n    public Int32 QuantityOnHand { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n    public void When(NewProductAddedToWarehouse evt)\r\n    {\r\n        AggregateIdentity = evt.AggregateIdentity;\r\n        Barcode = evt.Barcode;\r\n        Name = evt.Name;\r\n        Description = evt.Description;\r\n        Discontinued = false;\r\n        Suspended = false;\r\n        ItemCode = evt.ItemCode;\r\n        LastChanged = evt.Timestamp;\r\n        QuantityOnHand = 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void When(Renamed evt)\r\n    {\r\n        Name = evt.Name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void When(Discontinued evt)\r\n    {\r\n        Discontinued = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void When(Suspended evt)\r\n    {\r\n        Suspended = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void When(StockReceived evt)\r\n    {\r\n        QuantityOnHand += evt.Quantity;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void When(StockBookedOut evt)\r\n    {\r\n        QuantityOnHand -= evt.Quantity;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see that the _ProductAggregate_ inherits from _AggregateBase_ and has a constructor which accepts a set of events. These events are effectively a history of what has happened to the product throughout its life.\r\n\r\nThere are various _When_ methods, which are capable of accepting individual events as parameters. Each _When_ method acts upon the event by responding in a way that mimics what would happen in the business. For instance, we see that the _Renamed_ event changes the name on the aggregate and the _StockReceived_ and _StockBookedOut_ events control the level of stock for the product. \r\n\r\nThe reason we pass a set of events into the constructor is that the base class executes the associated When method for each event in that set to rehydrate the aggregate based on actual history. This allows us to change how the domain responds to certain events historically. The code below illustrates what the base constructor does.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nforeach (IEvent @event in events)\r\n{\r\n    InvokeEvent(this, @event);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _InvokeEvent_ method simply calls the required When method on the aggregate in sequence. By the time events are passed to the constructore, they are already sorted by timestamp.\r\n\r\nEvents have version numbers attached to them, so we have the ability to change our domain logic based on different sets of events. This makes dealing with change a bit less painful. For extensive changes in the domain model, it is suggested that a migration approach be followed and that events are rewritten.\r\n\r\nThat's cool and stuff, but how the hell do I get hold of an aggregate once I've created it?\r\n```C#\r\nvar product = AggregateBuilder.Get<ProductAggregate>(_productId);\r\n```\r\nAggregates have GUIDs for unique identifiers. The AggregateBuilder.Get method builds an aggregate from its events that are fetched from the event store based on its unique key.\r\n\r\n#####DSL\r\n_coming soon_\r\n#####Interceptor\r\n_coming soon_\r\n#####Aggregate Update Publisher Extension\r\n_coming soon_\r\n#####MongoDB Storage Extension\r\n_coming soon_\r\n#####NEventStore Extension\r\n_coming soon_\r\n#####Basic In Memory Cache Extension\r\n_coming soon_\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
