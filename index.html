        <p>A friendly and easy to use framework based on <a href="http://abdullin.com/cqrs">CQRS</a> principles with a fluid configuration interface which wires up some commonly used components common in a CQRS implementation using event sourcing. It includes a simple and fluid tool for defining aggregates, events, services and commands which generates the skeleton code required for all of these items, saving time and achieving consistency.</p>

<p>The framework uses <a href="http://masstransit-project.com/">MassTransit</a> as a message bus wrapper, which means that you could use either <a href="http://rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Message_Queuing">MSMQ</a> as an event queue. 
Events are persisted through the excellent <a href="http://neventstore.org">NEventStore</a> library which has support for a wide range of databases including <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://ravendb.net">RavenDB</a> and various flavours of SQL.</p>

<p>A basic and functional example of a domain built with the framework is included under the Cuttlefish.ExampleApp.Domain folder. It illustrates the use of commands, aggregates, services and events in the context of the Cuttlefish framework.</p>

<a name="quick-setup" class="anchor" href="#quick-setup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Setup</h5>

<p>Getting the framework up and running is super easy. Assuming that we are using RabbitMQ with a MongoDB event store backing, we would set up the framework as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Starts up the configuration interface</span>
<span class="n">Core</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Configure</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="c1">// Specify which root namespace reflection should use for finding aggregates, </span>

    <span class="c1">// For testing and extension purposes only at present, specifies which in-memory cache to </span>

            <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Build</span><span class="p">())</span>

    <span class="c1">// Configures the aggregate update publisher, which will push entire aggregates to the </span>

    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">sbc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ReceiveFrom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"rabbitmq://localhost/aggregate_updates"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}))</span>

    <span class="c1">// Wires everything up for us.</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Done</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will wire up all the components required by the framework.  Out of the box, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>integration with RabbitMQ through MassTransit</li>
<li>integration with NEventStore using any of the supported persistence adapters. (Mongo, Raven, MS/MySQL)</li>
<li>a very basic low-volume in-memory aggregate cache (for testing and small projects)</li>
<li>a mongo aggregate cache which saves the latest version of each aggregate to disc using MongoDB</li>
<li>dependency injection using StructureMap</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="future-plans" class="anchor" href="#future-plans"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Plans</h3>

<p>The framework is easy to extend and there are plans in the pipeline to support the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Distributed command handler</li>
<li>  Auto-generated SignalR endpoints for decorated aggregate events</li>
<li>  Auto-generated ASP.NET MVC controller endpoints for calling domain commands</li>
<li>  The ability to run an in-memory environment for prototyping purposes based purely on the domain specification file. (long term goal)</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="the-framework-consists-of-the-following-core-components" class="anchor" href="#the-framework-consists-of-the-following-core-components"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The framework consists of the following core components:</h3>

<h5>
<a name="core" class="anchor" href="#core"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core</h5>

<p>The core provides the most basic functionality as well as base classes and interfaces for defining aggregates, services, commands and events. </p>

<p>The 4 things you'll need to work with to start setting up your domain are commands, events, services and aggregates.</p>

<h6>
<a name="commands" class="anchor" href="#commands"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commands</h6>

<p>We'll start with commands. They tell our domain what to do. They can be defined by implementing the ICommand interface as below. Commands are handled by either aggregates or services, but we'll get to how that works in a bit.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, we are creating a command which tells the warehouse service to start stocking a certain product. The command conveys information that would be required by the domain to perform the action the command triggers.</p>

<p>To execute commands against domain services or aggregates, we make use of the CommandRouter. The router is clever enough to know which service or aggregate should react to the command. Only a single handler may be registered to handle commands. The code below illustrates how we would execute a command through the router.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">_productName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"Widget X"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">_description</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"blah blah blah"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">_itemcode</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"X0001"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">_barcode</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"123456"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">newProductCommand</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">StartStockingProduct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Guid</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NewGuid</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">_itemcode</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">_productName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_description</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_barcode</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">CommandRouter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ExecuteCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">newProductCommand</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, the command router knows which handler the command should be routed to. The service or aggregate would then respond by persisting an event of what has been executed to the eventstore. More on that later...</p>

<p>What do these aggregates and services look like? You might ask. Well, here is an example of a service which models the way a warehouse might work in an over-simplified business scenario.</p>

<p>From the code above, we can see that services implement the <em>IService</em> interface, which is used to decorate the resulting class as being a service.</p>

<p>We also see a bunch of <em>On</em> methods; each accepting a single command object as a parameter. These are the command handlers. Aggregates are also able to have command handlers, in cases where it makes sense to model the domain in such a manner. The role of a command handler is to establish whether a command is valid and the state of the aggregate in question permits the action which the command is trying to execute. If all goes well and the command is able to execute without failing business rule validation, an event is created to signify that an action has taken place.</p>

<p>The event router is used to publish events from Services. This is done by simply calling the event router and providing an event with the required parameters and type.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">EventRouter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">FireEventOnAggregate</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">ProductAggregate</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Discontinued</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cmd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AggregateIdentity</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will cause an event to be persisted to the event store; the event to be published to the messagebus (if specified in the core setup); and if enabled, it will also cause the latest version of the aggregate which responds to the event (if any) to be published to the specified cache.</p>

<p>The last thing we see in our service, is that there are a few methods that wrap business logic or validation logic. It is a good idea to put these into separate methods, as business logic is often re-used within an application domain.</p>

<p>Events are very similar to commands in that they are merely carriers of information. In the case of commands, we wish to <em>carry intent</em>. In the case of events, we wish to carry <em>'what has been done'</em>. </p>

<p>The event above is raised when the <em>AcceptShipmentOfProduct</em> command is handled in our service. We could have easily put the command handler on the <em>ProductAggregate</em> if we wanted to, but in this case, it made more semantic sense to let the warehouse take care of accepting shipments.</p>

<p>The event only contains information that is required to process the fact that stock has been received. In the next section we will take a look at the way events are handled by aggregates.</p>

<p>Aggregates are the meat of our domain. They are generally models of real-world items or documents and should be rich and extensive. In the example below, we are modeling a product from a warehouse perspective. The warehouse doesn't care about pricing information, as its main area of concern is stock levels and maintaining a catalogue.</p>

<p>We see that the <em>ProductAggregate</em> inherits from <em>AggregateBase</em> and has a constructor which accepts a set of events. These events are effectively a history of what has happened to the product throughout its life.</p>

<p>There are various <em>When</em> methods, which are capable of accepting individual events as parameters. Each <em>When</em> method acts upon the event by responding in a way that mimics what would happen in the business. For instance, we see that the <em>Renamed</em> event changes the name on the aggregate and the <em>StockReceived</em> and <em>StockBookedOut</em> events control the level of stock for the product. </p>

<p>The reason we pass a set of events into the constructor is that the base class executes the associated When method for each event in that set to rehydrate the aggregate based on actual history. This allows us to change how the domain responds to certain events historically. The code below illustrates what the base constructor does.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IEvent</span> <span class="n">@event</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">events</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">InvokeEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">@event</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <em>InvokeEvent</em> method simply calls the required When method on the aggregate in sequence. By the time events are passed to the constructore, they are already sorted by timestamp.</p>

<p>Events have version numbers attached to them, so we have the ability to change our domain logic based on different sets of events. This makes dealing with change a bit less painful. For extensive changes in the domain model, it is suggested that a migration approach be followed and that events are rewritten.</p>

<p>That's cool and stuff, but how the hell do I get hold of an aggregate once I've created it?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">product</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">AggregateBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Get</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">ProductAggregate</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="n">_productId</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Aggregates have GUIDs for unique identifiers. The AggregateBuilder.Get method builds an aggregate from its events that are fetched from the event store based on its unique key.</p>

If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</p>
